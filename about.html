		        <h1 class="purple-headings">What is Catdopolis?</h1>

		        <p>Catdopolis is a fictional cat adoption site. This site is designed to portray the fictional presence of Catdopolis, a cat adoption facility in the fictional town of Milson, Georgia. Catdopolis provides an array of beautiful, spunky, and loveable cats along with the portrayal of their potential adoption as a means of bringing attention to the wonderful act of adopting a cat. Adopting a cat can help not only the cat to have a successful life, but to also add to the love and quality of your own. The following information will be worded as if it was present on an actual site. Once more, I would like to remind you of this site's presence as a fictional entity.</p>

	          <h2 class="purple-headings">Why Adopt?</h2>

	          <p>Here at Catdopolis we encourage people to adopt because it can not only change the life of the cat for the better, it may also change the life of the adopter. Though cats may have a reputation with some as being moody, they are loveable and have a lot of love to give. Many cats do not find a home sometimes and are unfortunately left alone. Here at Catdopolis we have policies in place to ensure their longevity, however, we seek diligently to find them a home, otherwise they are transferred  to one of our sister facilities or a foster home for extended care. Your fur baby may be here right now, just waiting on you.</p>
